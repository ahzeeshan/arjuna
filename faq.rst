Frequently asked questions
==========================

Can you install software that I need for my research?
-----------------------------------------------------

The short answer is no. 

It is recommended that all users install specific software locally on in thier respective /home directory. This allows the software to be instantanously usable on the backend. The /home directory is mounted to the external RAID storage array so the compute nodes can access the program right away. If the program were to be installed on the compute node image directly by an administrator, the compute node would have to be rebooted in order for the changes to take effect. For more on this, see the short description of the cluster architecture. Installing locally also allows you to manage and maintain the software yourself so that it is up to date. 

Before installing software, please refer to the software already installed locally by other users on the cluster. 



Can I have access to the GPU nodes?
-----------------------------------

The GPU nodes are available to users of the Viswanathan, Lane, and Sekar groups. If your advisor is in Chemical Engineering, you may request limited access to GPU nodes.
